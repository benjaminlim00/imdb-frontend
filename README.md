# Movie Search Algorithm Frontend

This project is a frontend implementation of an algorithm that utilizes the Okapi BM25 algorithm to find the most similar movie based on a search query. It was developed as a part of a school project at the Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD).

## Description

The Movie Search Algorithm Frontend project aims to provide a user-friendly interface for searching movies using a search query. The frontend leverages the Okapi BM25 algorithm, a ranking function commonly used in information retrieval, to calculate the relevance of movies to a given search query.

The project consists of two main components: the frontend user interface and the backend algorithm. The frontend is responsible for accepting user input, sending the search query to the backend, and displaying the results in a visually appealing manner. The backend algorithm processes the search query, calculates the relevance scores of movies using Okapi BM25, and returns the most similar movie as the result.
